# Calculator Project

A simple and functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I created this project to strengthen my frontend skills and showcase my ability to build interactive web applications from scratch.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
- Supports decimal numbers (.) and double zero (00)
- AC button to clear the display
- DEL button to delete the last input
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Clean and responsive design

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ujjwal-Darnal/calculator.git
2. Open the project folder and open index.html in your browser.
(Optional: Use the Live Server extension in VS Code for faster testing.)
3. Click the buttons to perform calculations.

## Why I Built This
I built this calculator to improve my understanding of:
- Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript
- Handling user interactions and events
- Building a functional UI with HTML and CSS
- Writing clean, maintainable code

This project also serves as a simple example of my frontend skills.
